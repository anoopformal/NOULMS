                                    The University seeks to recover the lost connections and partnerships that existed in the region
                                    called Asia, before the onset of historical forces that led to their dissolution.
                                    Asian cultures have multiple links that go deep into the past and are reflected in a 
                                    variety of common cultural features. The re-discovery of inter-Asian linkages in recent 
                                    times has led to a resurgence in discovering and building upon a shared history. Nalanda
                                    University is envisaged as an icon of this new Asian renaissance: a creative space that 
                                    will be for future generations a center of inter-civilizational dialogue.

                                    Towards the Southeast of Patna, the Capital City of Bihar State in India, is a village called the ‘Bada Gaon’, in the vicinity of which, are the world famous ruins of Nalanda University.<br>
                                    Founded in the 5th Century A.D., Nalanda is known as the ancient seat of learning. 2,000 Teachers and 10,000 Students from all over the Buddhist world lived and studied at Nalanda, the first Residential International University of the World. A walk in the ruins of the university, takes you to an era, that saw India leading in imparting knowledge, to the world – the era when India was a coveted place for studies. The University flourished during the 5th and 12th century.<br>
                                    Although Nalanda is one of the places distinguished as having been blessed by the presence of the Buddha, it later became particularly renowned as the site of the great monastic university of the same name , which was to become the crown jewel of the development of Buddhism in India. The name may derive from one of Shakyamuni’s former births , when hewas a king whose capital was here. Nalanda was one of his epithets meaning “insatiable in giving.”
                                    The Gupta kings patronised these monasteries, built in old Kushan architectural style, in a row of cells around a courtyard. Ashoka and Harshavardhana were some of its most celebrated patrons who built temples and monasteries here.<br> Recent excavations have unearthed elaborate structures here. Hiuen Tsang had left ecstatic accounts of both the ambiance and architectureof this unique university of ancient times.<br> Modern historians have tentatively 
                                    dated the founding of a monastery at Nalanda as being in the fifth century.However, this may not be accurate. For example,the standard biographiesof the teacher Nagarjuna, believed by most historians to have been born around 150 AD, are quite specific about his having received ordination at Nalanda monastery when he was seven years old. Further, his teacher Rahulabhadra is said to have lived there for some time before that. We may infer that there were a monastery or monasteries at Nalanda long before the foundation of the later Great Mahavihara.
